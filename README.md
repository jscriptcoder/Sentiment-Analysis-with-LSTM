# Sentiment Analysis with LSTMs

**NOTE:** This project is an optional excercise from [Deep Learning Nanodegree by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

My solution: [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jscriptcoder/Sentiment-Analysis-with-LSTM/blob/master/Sentiment_RNN.ipynb)

Pytorch implementation of a Sentiment Analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM cells. Using an RNN rather than a strictly feedforward network is more accurate since we can include information about the sequence of words.
